# Offshoots

Offshoots is an easy to DIY, Arduino Nano based adaptation of
Mutable Instruments' Branches. Heavily inspired by sound-force.nl's Through-Hole Braids and Quinie.nl's NanoGris.

Only functional difference with Branches is Offshoots doesn't "remember" which output is high when leaving latch mode and coming back to it again. It needs a new input to latch to one of the outputs.

The photos included are of the prototype version of the board. I messed up the silkscreen, but that has been corrected. If you have some boards made, please send me photos! I also corrected a couple of other minor errors, so technically, this version of the board on github is untested, but I am very confident it works as intended.
